   <p> Hi.... My name is Adekomi Abdulhaleem, i am a student of University
       of Lagos, the great faculty, faculty of Engineering. I got admission into 
       Unilag in the year 2018. I knew nothing about programming till mid 2018.
       Should i tell you more? Click below to get more of my biography....

</form>
   <div id="demo1"> <p>Okay, let's continue... While i was in secondary school then, i was a
    dull guy that has no future ambition. When i finished, i wrote waec, i also wrote jamb this same year 
    i thought i passed with a score of 243 aiming for engineering. Even my waec result is'nt too good 
    for Systems Engineering in Unilag.After everything i was 4 points behind cashment(too bad), so, i 
    was not admitted. It was not painful to me then because i was the unserious type.
    The only things i do then was to play football, play games, and watch football.
    I did a lot of overnights playing games, during the i play football.
    But now i can say it to everybody that the greatest thing that has ever happened to me 
    is being rejected by Unilag the first time i wrote utme. The one year i spent at home gave me a change
    of mindset, thinking, and all....</p>
    <p> The overnights i did then playing games has now turned to reading, coding
    designing. Within that time i got admission and now i've learnt how to create a website and i create this
    website from scratch with my little knowledge. I wrote my first line of code on <i>06/07/2019 11:57 PM </i>. It was 
    fun, i wrote it as a code and will always make reference to it. I just decided to launch a website with the 
    little knowledge i've gathered so far. I always believe my life started two years ago, the sixteen 
    years i've spent earlier were wasted. I say a big thank you to those who have helped to bring this up.</p>>
